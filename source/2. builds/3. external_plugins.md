## External Plugins

Builds are often times solving common problems. To name a few: HTML templating, JS/CSS/image minification, or iconfont generation. For that reason, it is reasonable to reuse plugins across projects. A trivial solution to that would be to require an external build module (package) from the current build module and reflect its interface. However, rJS simplifies reusability by allowing for declaration of an external build module within the build configuration JSON. The respective property is `package`. If a package is such references, rJS will consult th

``` json
{
  "package": "../all-plugins/minifier/plugin.js"
}
```

or

``` json
{
  "package": "@example.org/plugin"
}
```

> rJS will ignore an external plugin reference in case a local build module does exists.

> The module resolution mechanism is the one from NPM, i.e. both paths and package names are allowed.
