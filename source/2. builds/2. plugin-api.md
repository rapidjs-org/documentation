## Plugin API

The rJS plugin API is a simple, yet powerful set of classes that virtualise all files that matter to a plugin – the raw files to-be-built, as well as the eventual build results. rJS mirrors the known filesystem analogies – namely directories and files. It provides just the information necessary to transform the individual build files residing in a respective plugin directory into files rJS is ought to build.

### File

Instances of the `File` class bear the significant build information through their contents. A file carries a set of meta properties, such as its name or path relative to the target directory (that can be either the plugin directory root for raw source files; or the public files directory root for built files). Besides, its `content` property gives access to the file contents.

``` ts
export class File {
  public readonly relativePath: string;
  public readonly name: string;
  public readonly extension: string;
  
  constructor(relativePath: string, contents?: Buffer | string);
  
  public readonly contents?: Buffer|string;
}
```

### Directory

Just as obvious as the `File` class' purpose, `Directory` instances mirror hierarchy in the filesystem. A directory can be read in two ways: Either, by its `nodes` property to get an array of all nodes (files and directories) it comprises. Or, by traversing the directory and handling each underlying node via callback.

``` ts
export class Directory {
  public readonly relativePath: string;
  public readonly name: string;
  
  public nodes: (Directory|File)[];
  
  constructor(relativePath: string, nodes: AFilesystemNode[] = []);
  
  public get(relativePath: string): Directory|File;

  public traverse(
    cb: (node: Directory|File) => void,
    recursive: boolean = false
  );
}
```
