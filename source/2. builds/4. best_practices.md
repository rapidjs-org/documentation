## Best Practices

The framework given by rJS does enforce and favour many positive attributes and practices. However, plugins are just constrained through its interface. Apart from that they base oin individual design decisions influenced by individual requirements and taste. The following list of best practices should help with developing quality plugins.

### Single Responsibility

By design, plugins are decoupled as they are non-interdependent. To obtain high cohesion, however, plugins are ought to  serve a single build purpose. For instance, a plugin should not both minify images, and compile an iconfont. Those unrelated purposes should be distributed across two separate plugins.

### Filesystem Locality

Strong encapsulation of plugins is inherent to seamless reusability. That being said, file access from within the plugin should not exceed its filesystem boundary. This is, file references (as in import statements) must not cross the plugin root directory.

### Runtime Mode Sensitivity

Wherever reasonable, rJS is finetuned to the runtime modes. Individual plugin behaviour should also consider the passed development mode flag in order to accordingly optimise its behaviour. As an example, a CSS minifier plugin would not need to minify source in development mode.
