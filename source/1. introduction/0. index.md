# Introduction

### What is rJS?

rJS is a plugin-based build interface, and a progressive web server based on virtual build capabilites. What does that mean? Let's roughly break that down at this stage: At the core, rJS is no more than a web application build tool. By fundamental design principle, its developer interface strongly integrates with both the JavaScript, and the UNIX filesystem anatomy. In its purest form, rJS can be used in the build step to build and emit files. Those files could then be deployed to any web server, such as an [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org) server. However, the rJS ecosystem can progressively be used as a web server that hides the plugin-based builds behind the server interface. Implementing such optimised virtual builds, the rJS server application eliminates an explicit build step. Moreover, the server provides development- to production-ready features.

### Runtime Environments

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) &hairsp; <span class="badge">coming soon</span>
- [Deno](https://deno.com) &hairsp; <span class="badge">coming soon</span>

### Prerequisites

- Node.js latest
- [NPM](https://npmjs.com) latest (ships with Node.js installer)

### Installation

``` console
npm install -g @rapidjs.org/rjs
```

### Usage

The recommended way to use rJS is through its command line interface (CLI). Installed as above, the generic CLI synopsis is as follows:

``` console
rjs <command> [<sub-command>]* [--<arg:name>|-<arg:shorthand> [<option>]?]*
```

For example `rjs emit --public-dir ./web`.

> Use `rjs help` at any time to display help in the console.

> Examples in this documentation will assume global accessibility of the rJS package. In case it has been installed locally – i.e. without the `-g` flag – prefix commands with `npx`, e.g. `npx rjs help`.

### Runtime Modes

An rJS appliction runtime knows two different modes of operation: Production mode (which is the default), and development mode. Development mode requires explicit activation. Both the rJS framework itself, as well as each build plugin will adjust its behaviour based on the current runtime mode.

> As simple to use rJS has been designed, as simple and quick of a read is this documentation.
