# CI/CD

rJS supports webhook-based CI/CD: An rJS server automatically listens for webhook events in order to pull and rebuild repository contents. Any kind of a [GitHub Webhook](https://docs.github.com/webhooks/) is supported. To integrate with rJS CI/CD, it requires two things:

1. A GitHub repository that hosts the application, and
2. a webhook configured to signal repository changes.

> Upon an incoming webhook event, the repository contents are pulled from the `main` branch.

<sub><code>package.json</code></sub>

``` json
{
  "repository": {
    "url": "git+https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>"
  }
}
```

## Secrets

Any kind of static configuration belongs to the `rjs.config.json`. However, confidential information is only read from `.env` files that should on the contrary not be checked into a repository. Both the webhook secret, as well as the remote API key need to be stored in the application root directory `.env` file:

``` dir
├─ /api …
├─ /public …
├─ /src …
└─ .env
```

<sub><code>.env</code></sub>

``` ini
WEBHOOK_SECRET=secret
WEBHOOK_AUTH=key
```

> An authentication key is only required if the respective repository is private.
