# Server

rJS is referred to as build interface, and a progressive web server based on virtual build capabilites. The term progressive hereby depicts that the build interface can be used in isolation, but also through a file server. The server capabilities, in turn, can be used either only for development purposes, but also in production. The most abstract design principle regarding the rJS server has been file-implicity. This means that it should derive most of its behaviour from the given files, rather than programmatic routing descriptions. In that sense, it can be seen as a JS-pendant to the traditional [L<u>A</u>M<u>P</u>](https://www.ibm.com/topics/lamp-stack) stack.
