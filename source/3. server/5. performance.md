## Performance

Compared to many other JavaScript-based server frameworks, like [Express](https://expressjs.com), rJS is deliberately engineered for performance.

### Clustering

In fact, an rJS server in production mode runs a cluster of concurrent request handler processes, which themselves host a set of parallel handler threads each. The cluster cardinality does thereby depend on the hardware the rJS super process is run on.

### Configuration

Besides aforementioned hardware utilisation, certain behavioural performance measures are configurable – just as with certain security measures. Different caching mechanisms play a key role in soft performance gains of rJS. The below listing presents noteworthy performance measures, and their related configuration parameter (with the default value).

``` json
{
  "performance": {
    …
  }
}
```

#### Client Cache

The client cache duration tells web clients how long they can (re)use a requested asset resource until they shall request it again. Furthermore, rJS only re-transmits a resource if it has changed (ETag).

``` js
performance.clientCacheMs: 86400000
```

> Unit: Milliseconds

#### Server Cache

The server cache complements the client-side caching mechanism. To prevent redundant system calls, rJS does only read static files again after the server cache runs out.

``` js
performance.serverCacheMs: 30000
```

> Unit: Milliseconds
