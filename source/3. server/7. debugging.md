## Debugging

It goes without saying that the development runtime mode is supposed to be activate during development and debugging cycles. Foremost, rJS adopts its behaviour to the requirements coming with a development environment. Most security measures and caching mechanism, as well as the process clustering is disabled in development mode. Plugins are furthermore thought to adopt development mode, too.

### Logs

When it comes to debugging, application output is the first thing to check. To maintain long term traceability, rJS mirrors console output to dated log files. The log files are written to a special directory `.logs`, which is created in the project root directory.

``` console
├─ /.logs
│  ├─ 2023-04-24.log
│  └─ 2023-10-31.log
├─ /public
└─ /plugins
```

### Conditional Virtual Builds

rJS does only perform virtual builds once on application start. In development mode, in contrast, virtual builds are triggered repeatedly to reflect development changes. But only if a virtual asset has been requested and the respective raw build files were modified.

> rJS does not implement a hot module replacement/reload mechanism. In fact, reloading the current development state in a web browser is much more efficient than continuous (and forced) updates.
