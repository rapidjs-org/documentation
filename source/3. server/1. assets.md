## Assets

For the most part, a web server simply serves files (assets) to a web client (usually a browser). An rJS server application automatically serves files from the public file directory (commonly `/public`).

``` dir
└─ /public
   ├─ /css
   │  └─ styles.css
   └─ script.js
```

``` urlmap
http://&ltHOST&gt/script.js       → 200: /public/script.js

http://&ltHOST&gt/css/styles.css  → 200: /public/css/styles.css
```

### Pages

Markup files that describe web pages represent a special type of file for web applications. rJS is all about JavaScript – with a focus on client-side hydration. Therefore, it does not work with any preprocessors. The sole type of page source files is plain HTML (`*.html`), which is accordingly augmented. In order to increase URL readability, page files are served over non-redundant URLs. This means that the `.html` file extension is to be implicit (omitted). As is common practice – page files with the name `index` indicate the default page for a directory and are also served implicitly.

``` dir
├─ /src …
└─ /public
   ├─ /products
   │  ├─ index.html
   │  ├─ food-hydrator.css
   │  └─ self-lacing-shoe.html
   └─ index.html
```

``` urlmap
http://&ltHOST&gt/index.html            → 301: http://&ltHOST&gt/
http://&ltHOST&gt/index                 → 301: http://&ltHOST&gt/
http://&ltHOST&gt/                      → 200: /public/index.html

http://&ltHOST&gt/products/index.html   → 301: http://&ltHOST&gt/products/
http://&ltHOST&gt/products/index        → 301: http://&ltHOST&gt/products/
http://&ltHOST&gt/products/             → 200: /public/products/index.html

http://&ltHOST&gt/food-hydrator.html    → 301: http://&ltHOST&gt/products/food-hydrator
http://&ltHOST&gt/food-hydrator         → 301: /public/products/food-hydrator.html
```

#### Error Pages

Whenever a web page is requested that does not exist, the server responds with a `404`(`Not Found`) status code. However, to also present visual feedback through a web client, the server automatically serves the next file in the hierarchy named `404.html`. This means, based on the requested pathname, it checks in the respective directory whether the `404.html` file exists. If it does, it is served, otherwise it repeats the check in the parent directory, up to the root directory.

``` dir
└─ /public
   ├─ /products
   │  └─ index.html
   ├─ /services
   │  ├─ index.html
   │  └─ 404.html
   └─ 404.html
```

``` urlmap
http://&ltHOST&gt/any.html             → 404: /public/404.html
http://&ltHOST&gt/products/any.html    → 301: /public/404.html
http://&ltHOST&gt/services/any.html    → 200: /public/services/404.html
```

> If no error page file is detected, the response will contain no body. 

### Virtual Assets

Virtual assets are where the core rJS build interface gets back into play with the web server environment. As described above, the file structure of the public directory is identically reflected to clients. However, with the server interface, rJS does not emit built files to the public directory. Instead, it virtually builds the files and stores them in memory in order not to clutter the public directory. Virtually built files can be used as public files whatsoever. This is, they can be referenced in code (such as a stylesheet href) just as if they were present in the public directory. In case there's a collision of a public directory file sharing a path with a virtually built file, rJS serves the explicit public file.

``` dir
├─ /src
│  └─ /scss
│     ├─ _normalize.scss
│     ├─ _elements.scss
│     ├─ app.scss
│     └─ __plugin.js
└─ /public
   └─ index.html
```

<small class="docs-filename">/src/scss/__plugin.js</small>

``` ts
module.exports = (rJS, pluginFiles: rJS.Filesystem) => {
  const cssFiles: rJS.File[] = [];
  /* SCSS transpilation … */
  
  return cssFiles;
  /* [
    { relativePath: "/app.css", contents: "…" }.
    …
  ] */
};
```

``` urlmap
http://&ltHOST&gt/          → 200: /public/index.html

http://&ltHOST&gt/app.scss  → 404

http://&ltHOST&gt/app.css   → 200: (/src/scss/&ltVIRTUAL&gt/)app.css
```
