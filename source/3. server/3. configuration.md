## Configuration

rJS implements a rich set of features that arrange for production-ready server applications. That being said, many parameters of the server can be configured to custom needs. Configuration is as simple – and as typical – as defining parameters through a configuration file. Defined known parameters will override the default parameter values. The configuration file must be a `JSON` named `rjs.config.json`.

### Custom Headers

Where reasonable, the rJS server defines headers out-of-the-box. A scenario for providing a configuration file is to define custom headers that override or supplement the headers written out by rJS. A practical use case could for instance be to describe frame options, such as `X-Frame-Options`.

``` json
{
  "headers": {
    "X-Frame-Options": "SAMEORIGIN",
    "X-Organization": "Example Org."
  }
}
```

### `www.` Subdomain Strategy

The sobdomain `www` is a historical remnant, but still used with default host names. rJS enforces whether to use the `www` subdomain. Accordingly, the configuration accepts either `never` (default) or `always`.

``` json
{
  "www": "never"
}
```
