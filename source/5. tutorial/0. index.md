# Tutorial

This tutorial gives a hands on experience with the key concepts of rJS. You should easily be able to follow it, whether you already studied the documentation, or just want learn as you go.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v22 or later
- [NPM.js](https://npmjs.com) latest (ships with Node.js installer)
- [rJS](https://github.com/rapidjs-org/rJS) latest (install as below)

``` console
npm install -g @rapidjs.org/rjs
```

### Setup

The tutorial will walk you through just the key concepts of rJS-based application development. We will develop a basic lottery web application – one that “draws” 6 distinct from a set of 49 numbers. rJS is a file-first framework. This means, most of its behaviour is based on the given files and file structure. Therefore, the first step to pursue regards setting up our project's filesystem:

``` console
mkdir lottery-app && cd lottery-app
mkdir api
mkdir plugins
mkdir public
```

``` dir
└─ /lottery-app
   ├─ /api
   ├─ /src
   └─ /public
```

> If not via above commands, create the stated structure. Then open a console and change to the `/lottery-app` directory (project root).
