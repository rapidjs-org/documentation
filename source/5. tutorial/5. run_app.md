## Run App

Let's check out our previously developed application in a web browser. Run the `serve` command **with** the development mode flag `-D`, as well as open `http://localhost:7777` in your browser:

``` console
rjs serve -D
```

> You can play around with the source files. As we toggled development mode, you can immediately view modification-based changes in the browser.

#### Production Mode

An rJS-based application can be served under production circumstances (read [Server Documentation](/docs?p=server:index)). In fact, the production runtime mode is enabled by default â€“ including to common security and performance measures. Simply run the `serve` command **without** the development mode flag `-D`:

``` console
rjs serve
```

### Third-party Server

There might be cases in which you want to use a traditional web server, such as [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org). rJS is a progressive framework that let's you opt-in to server features. While you can always use rJS as a development server, built files can also just be written out on disc to the `/public` directory. To achieve this, run the `emit` command:

``` console
rjs emit
```
