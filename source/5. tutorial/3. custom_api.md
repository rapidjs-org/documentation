## Custom API

The applcation logic is simple: Listen for a button click to generate an ordered sequence of six distinct integers (between 1 and 49). To ensure the lottery cannot be rigged, however, the sequence must not be generated on the client-side. For such cases, rJS introduces a concept we call ‘leaky scope’. This allows us to perform a remote procedure call on the isolated server-side. This can also be seen as a custom, frontend-directed API. Modules whose exports are available on the client-side are supposed to be available in the `/api` directory. Let's create a leaky, custom API module:

``` dir
.
├─ /api
│  └─ lottery.js
├─ /src
│  └─ /scripts
│  │  ├─ app.js
│  │  └─ __rjs.plugin.js
│  └─ /scripts …
└─ /public …
```

<small class="docs-filename">/api/lottery.js</small>

``` js
export function drawLottery() {
  return [ ...Array(49).keys() ]
    .sort((a, b) => 0.5 - Math.random())
    .slice(0, 6)
    .sort();
}
```

Access of the leaky `drawLottery()` method from the `/api/lottery.js` module from client-side scope is simple: Read it through the reserved global identifier `rJS`, by indexing the module path (relative to the web root):

<small class="docs-filename">/src/scripts/app.js</small>

``` js
addEventListener("DOCContentLoaded", () => {
  const button = document.querySelector("button");
  const results = document.querySelector("#results");

  button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
    results.textContent = (
      await rJS["/api/lottery"].drawLottery()
    ).join(", ");
  });
});
```

> The above snippet ‘hydrates’ the web page with the obtained data with vanilla JavaScript. This could be done just as well using a frontend framework (e.g. [Vue](https://vuejs.org)).
