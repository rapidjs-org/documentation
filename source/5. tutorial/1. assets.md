## Assets

The `/public` directory is where all static files (assets) are supposed to reside, so they can be served by rJS. All we need is a single page to display the lottery drawing result. Thus, we create a default page file named `index.html`.

``` dir
.
├─ /api
├─ /src
└─ /public
   └─ index.html
```

<small class="docs-filename">/public/index.html</small>

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Lottery App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <h1>Lottery</h1>
    <button type="button">Draw 6 from 49</button>
    <strong id="#results"></strong>
  </body>
</html>
```
